Being able to make a rapid and successful transition into a first significant job is crucial for long-term labor-market attachment. We approach the question of continuity or change in school-towork transitions by comparing the experiences of four birth cohorts of early school leavers in Italy, where they still constitute a sizeable group as of today. Italy makes for an interesting case study due to the length of school-to-work transitions and the extent of gender differences in this phase. In an era of educational expansion and increased female activation, studying changes in low-educated women’s labor-market access brings into focus the question of who is really left behind. Using data from the 2009 \"Multi-purpose Survey on Household and Social Subjects,\"\" we use discrete time logistic regression models to estimate the probability of transitioning to the first significant job for early school leavers born between 1954 and 1993. We find that gender differences are strikingly persistent across birth cohorts, even after controlling for sociodemographic variables as well as for time-varying fertility and partnership histories.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Who is really \"left behind\"?

Do individual electoral participation pattern differ across context with varying degrees of residential segregation? How similar are employment biographies across cohorts of workers who entered the labor market before and after the recent economic crisis? Do democratization processes differ depending on the pathways of turnover between rightist and leftist parties? Answering these research questions requires the application of analysis tools that capture how processes unfold over time. Within the toolkit of longitudinal methods, we consider social sequence analysis to be one of the most powerful and versatile ones – particularly when it comes to studying longitudinal categorical data.\nSequence analysis was introduced in the social sciences in the 1980s. Andrew Abbott, inspired by the treatment of DNA strings in biology, developed it as a technique to study social processes that unfold over time as sequences of events (Abbott \u0026amp; Forrest, 1986). Sequence analysis has gained increasing attention as the recent widespread availability of longitudinal data made it possible to address sequence-oriented questions. The mainstream application of sequence analysis relies on optimal matching techniques to measure the distance between sequences that represent the individual realization of a certain process and on the clustering of such sequences to identify typical trajectories. Regression analysis is often applied as a second step to investigate why (and not only how) sequences resemble or differ from each other. In the last ten years, several innovations have been introduced to overcome weaknesses and limitation of the initial proposition. A sequence analysis introductory book is currently missing in the QASS series. Therefore, the book will complement the rich catalogue of the QASS series with an up-to-date introduction to a technique that is steadily gaining popularity.\nSeveral statistical software tools made it available to a broader public. However, existing publications on sequence analysis that might serve the purpose of teaching and learning its basics, are scattered across several journal articles, books, and software documentations. This makes it hard for newcomers to figure out where to start and to identify good practices for performing methodologically sound analyses. To answer these needs, the book introduces the basics of sequence analysis to guide practitioners and support instructors along the working flow of sequence analysis. The presentation of statistical, substantive, and theoretical foundations will be enriched by examples to help the reader in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of specific analytical choices. The extensive ancillary material will support self-learning by offering exercises and solutions based on real data and research questions in the field of life course research. Finally, the book will include practical guidelines considering recent advances and innovations in sequence analysis.\n","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"3141da2aaac312a7f513ffb1725fc399","permalink":"/project/project_1_sabook/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project_1_sabook/","section":"project","summary":"With Marcel Raab (University of Mannheim).

Importantly, they might also affect subjective poverty in households that are above the poverty threshold. We contribute to the literature by studying the relationship between subjective and objective in-work poverty and how this relationship is affected by household members’ job characteristics. We use data from the 2014 wave of the Italian module of the EU-SILC survey. Italy is an interesting case as–similarly to other Southern European countries–the share of individuals and households reporting subjective hardship is strikingly high compared to the levels reported in other EU areas. We find no statistically significant differences in the association between subjective poverty and different degrees of objective poverty by different levels of work intensity. Conversely, subjective poverty is positively associated with the instability of household members’ job contracts. We argue that policies aimed at increasing work intensity rather than work stability might not help to reduce subjective poverty as well as its (negative) spillover effects on other life domains—such as well-being, adequate levels of consumption, and social integration.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Being working poor or feeling working poor?

The analyses focus on a cohort of young Italian workers who entered the labour market after the deregulatory reforms of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Instead of looking at the timing of isolated transitions between employment states, 7-year-long trajectories are considered to identify differences by gender and education in the probability of experiencing more stable and protected early-careers. Italy is a particularly interesting country-case because of its high youth unemployment rates and difficult school-to-work transitions into the protected labour market segment. The analyses draw on AD-SILC, a unique data source that combines administrative records of complete employment histories and survey data and offers an unprecedented, highly detailed distinction between a wide range of non-standard employment relationships. Applying sequence analysis, eight early-career types characterized by different degrees of employment continuity and stability are identified. Multivariate logistic regression estimates show that women—especially if lower-educated—are more likely than men to experience pathways characterized by instability and weak (or absent) employment and social security protection, that ultimately lead to more precarious early careers.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Navigating the early career.

We compare two relative measures of in-work poverty. The individual definition refers to workers whose salary is below 60% of the median, while the household-level definition refers to individuals whose household income is below 60% of the median. Microdata from the 2014 EU-SILC survey and macrodata on involuntary part-time employment and female labor market participation are used to perform a multilevel analysis on 31 European countries. The results show a positive relationship between involuntary part-time work and in-work poverty according to the household definition. Female labor market participation is positively associated with the individual definition and negatively with the household one. However, after controlling for the level of within-country income inequality, only the effect of the female employment rate remains positive and significant for the individual in-work. These results shed light on the multifaceted role of labor market characteristics related to female employment and their implications for policy. We argue that the promotion of female participation should be combined with explicit measures to reduce the disadvantageous position of women in the labor market.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Individual and household in-work poverty in Europe. understanding the role of labor market characteristics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Devilannova C.","Raitano M.","Struffolino E."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"e928a99b4b0f49350c87134add38cb2a","permalink":"/publication/devillanovaraitanostruffolino2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/devillanovaraitanostruffolino2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper adopts a long-term perspective in analysing the association between health and employment histories, often characterized by substantial mobility over time across multiple statuses and contractual arrangements. The available evidence is largely based on static or short-run dynamic approaches and is restricted to the comparison between few employment statuses. We investigate how different longitudinal employment trajectories defined over multiple yearly labour market states are associated with self-reported health in middle life. We use a unique dataset linking the Italian component of the EU-SILC cross-sectional samples (2004-2012) with individuals’ complete working histories from the National Social Security registers. We apply sequence and cluster analysis to reconstruct individual working histories between age 15 to 45 and to identify typical trajectories. We then estimate the association between employment trajectories and self-reported health at age 45.Trajectories characterized by intermittent working episodes and long periods of unemployment or inactivity are associated with worse health at age 45. Long-term exposure to blue-collar jobs (potentially physically demanding, more exposed to work accidents and allowing for low levels of individual control) operates similarly to persisting/intermittent joblessness in terms of health outcomes.Unlike “point-in-time” approaches, our sequence analysis application provides unique insights on the fact that the association between the configuration of complete trajectories as they unfold over time and health in middle life are significant and substantive over and above the time spent in specific labor market arrangements (e.g. unemployment) and type of occupation (e.g. blue collars).","tags":null,"title":"Multiple life-course employment trajectories and health.

This study contributes to the literature by considering differences by gender and education (and their interaction) in the ability to fulfil preferences for early retirement across welfare states. We use longitudinal data from the SHARE survey as it includes information on preferences for early retirement expressed before actual retirement. Wwe therefore avoid biases driven by the assessment of preferences for the timing of retirement after it occurred. We estimate discrete time regression models and find that positive preferences for early retirement are associated with an actual anticipation of retirement with respect to the statutory age. Although the size of the effect is small, it remains statistically significant even after models are adjusted for a number of potential confounding factors. However, no differences by gender and education (or their interaction) exist in the strength of the correspondence between preferences and behaviour. Finally, these results do not vary across welfare regimes. This evidence suggests that the timing of the transition to retirement is only marginally shaped by preferences and it is still strongly institutionalized, being a by-product of \"agency-within-structure\"\" mechanisms rather than an individualized process.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Did you realize your preferences for early retirement?

The empirical analyses rely on the 2005 and 2014 waves of the ISFOL-PLUS survey and show that the employment opportunities of youth who dropped out of school have substantially deteriorated over time, both in absolute terms and compared to those who attained an upper-secondary level certificate. The article discusses possible determinants of this negative trend. On the one hand, the increased negative selection of the group of early school leavers. On the other hand, the process of “crowding out” of workers with intermediate qualification levels from well-matching jobs. The results also show considerable gender differences and in particular the existence of a multiplicative disadvantage for female early school leavers, especially in Southern Italy.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Hard times.

Early school leaving is also connected to other negative outcomes such as poor health and lack of civic and political participation. From a policy perspective, early school leaving can therefore be considered a “new social risk”, as recognized by the EU strategy for growth for which the reduction of early school leaving to less than 10% is one of the main five targets to be met until the year 2020. Not only is early school leaving connected to negative labor market outcomes, but it also tends to hit the social groups that are most vulnerable in terms of labor market integration: children with learning difficulties, coming from socio-economically disadvantaged families or who have access to limited educational resources. Hence, early school leaving exacerbates social inequalities. When it comes to gender, however, the definition of a vulnerable group may prove elusive, because while women still face labor market disadvantages in most industrialized societies, in terms of educational attainment they have caught up to men and, in many countries, even overtaken them. Together with Portugal and Spain, Italy is one of the EU countries with the greatest proportion of early school leavers. In this country, early school leaving has been steadily declining since the 1990s, when it reached percentages of 30% or more. However, as of today still 15% of young Italians leave education and training before completing the upper-secondary cycle. This phenomenon is therefore alarming, especially if we consider the increasing difficulties that Italian youth is facing in labor-market entry: it suffices to say that as of 2015 the youth unemployment rate reached 40%. Moreover, in Italy, gender disparities are particularly strong: on the one hand, women’s participation to the labor market is very low and, even among the young cohorts, the women who work are more likely than men to have atypical and poorly-paid jobs. On the other hand, the gender gap is reversed when it comes to education: young women outnumber men by three to two among tertiary graduates and boys are vastly overrepresented among the pupils who do not reach a basic level of competences in core subjects.\nPublications in progress:\n  Struffolino E., Borgna C., Who is really left behind?

We present a comparative analysis across 31 European countries that considers the relationship between i) gender differences in working poor and ii) the prevalence of temporary work, part-time work, low-wage, and availability of childcare (specifically aiming at increase female participation). Women display higher likelihood of being working poor compared to men in all countries. The gender pay gap is the most relevant factor among those considered as proxies of unfavourable labour market characteristics for women.

Zooming in on Flanders, the poverty risk for this type of family is significantly higher compared to couple-with-children households and the general population; thus, labour market participation represents a crucial resource for individuals heading such households to cope with the economic needs of the family and to avoid long-lasting poverty or to rely extensively on social assistance. We use data from the Crossroads Bank of Social Security (CBSS Datawarehouse) to study Flemish lone mothers’ patterns of labour market participation and test the association between employment trajectories after lone parenthood and both individual and household characteristics. Flanders represents an interesting case because of (i) the relatively high diffusion of lone motherhood, (ii) the presence of welfare measures supporting a number of different types of recipients (even to different extents and not necessarily so generous to keep them out of poverty), and (iii) the availability of longitudinal data to observe lone mothers’ employment trajectories over time. We find that differences exist among lone mothers, who thus experience different risk of social exclusion driven by family and labour market arrangements set up to resolve the potentially contradictory trade-off between the needs for care and for income. The age at which mothers have children is crucial in understanding their future exclusion from the labour market. Selection into early lone motherhood is associated with lower employment opportunities. Furthermore, it is the number of children below 17 in the household rather than the presence of very small children that defines a lower probability of having a strong labour market attachment through full-time jobs, and that increases the likelihood of being unemployed/inactive and receiving welfare benefits.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Lone mothers in Belgium.

In this chapter, we analyse the labour force participation of immigrant women and non-migrants living in Switzerland, and compare them by distinguishing between mothers in couples and lone mothers. We use data from the Swiss Labour Force Survey (wave 2008, N = 6814). These data allow us to account for intra-group variation among the immigrants by distinguishing them by their migrant generation and their country of origin. The analyses include women aged 20 to 54 who were living with at least one child under age 18. The dependent variable in the multinomial regression analyses is employment status, differentiating between full-time employment, long and short part-time employment, and non-employment. Results indicate that lone motherhood prevalence is similar among migrant and Swiss mothers (11%). In both groups, lone mothers are less likely to be in employment than mothers in couples. However, we find variation among lone mothers by migrant status. Migrants have a higher non-employment rate overall. Among the employed women, migrant lone mothers tend to work full time, whereas non-migrant lone mothers tend to work part time. For lone mothers being an international migrant is therefore associated with an increased risk not only of being out of the labour force, but also of facing difficulties linked to work-family reconciliation. These results are relevant for the design of appropriate policies for migrants, lone parents, and work-family reconciliation, particularly in a societal context like Switzerland, where child care services are insufficient and the number of mothers who work full time is relatively small.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Migrant Status and Lone Motherhood.

Both methods rely on an epistemological framework that combines analytical and holistic elements. They share the notion of analytically approaching social phenomena without disregarding their complexity. We apply SA as a first step to analyze the unfolding of phenomena over time. Specifically, through discrepancy analysis of state sequences, one can identify the time points when trajectories (start to) diverge from each other. In a second, explanatory step, QCA is applied to investigate whether, at such crucial time points, some particular configurations of factors are logically sufficient for the occurrence of a given state (or outcome). We provide an illustrative application to women's employment trajectories in divided Germany by using data from the Adults Cohort of the German National Educational Panel (NEPS). By preserving the analytical and holistic perspective on trajectories, our proposed design highlights the dynamic of socio-demographic factors sufficient for women to be in employment or education at critical turning points over the life course. This design takes on the challenge, summarized in Abbott's call for a processual sociology, to investigate both the dynamics of social phenomena as lineages of successive events and the complexity of contextual characteristics of present moments. We conclude with an overview of research fields where our framework holds the promise of being applied fruitfully, namely life-course research, social stratification studies, policy evaluation, and comparative politics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Unpacking configurational dynamics.

Looking at changes in contraceptive use at first intercourse before and after liberalization of family planning institutions in Italy, we find no difference by social background in the restrictive regulation period, but difference for young men in the liberal period. The probability of contraceptive use occurred for both young men and women, but women remain less likely to use contraception than their male counterparts even after liberalization. For studying the role of specific institutions, we included macro-level indicators for access to and information on contraception.\n","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"8c0a8cc1140373c8d71e081fa91afa97","permalink":"/project/project_5_contraception/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project_5_contraception/","section":"project","summary":"With Hannah Zagel (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin)","tags":null,"title":"The stratification of contraceptive use at first intercourse in Italy, 1950-2006","type":"project"},{"authors":["Struffolino E.","Studer M.","Fasang A."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"2b0591847a0a684a566640e928383ef7","permalink":"/publication/studerstruffolinofasang2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/studerstruffolinofasang2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Gender, education, and family life courses in East and West Germany.

Vulnerability is a dynamic process during which individuals experience falls and lose resources, but might also rise and gain empowerment as an outcome of different coping and adaptation processes. The population of lone parents is increasingly heterogeneous in terms of social background and available resources to cope with the challenges posed by a new household arrangement. This implies that the experience of lone parenthood varies substantially across social groups. Such heterogeneity represents a new issue for the definition and the measurement of the relative disadvantage of lone parents and their families. Switzerland is an interesting case study because of the weak work-family reconciliation policies and the institutional configuration that discourage female labour market participation. We discuss how the transition to lone parenthood may translate in additional strains for those parents who have to face the increase in family and work responsibilities alone. We use data from different sources to describe a range of life domains in which lone parents may become vulnerable.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Vulnerabilität alleinerziehender Mütter in der Schweiz aus einer Lebensverlaufsperspektive","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Borgna C.","Struffolino E."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485907200,"objectID":"637405e00cdab9845d076c833d063433","permalink":"/publication/borgnastruffolino2017/","publishdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borgnastruffolino2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Compared to girls, boys are more at risk of early school leaving. However, it is unclear whether gender differences are driven by push factors, which alienate students from the school system, or pull factors, which attract them out of it. This paper examines gender differences in early school leaving, assessing the role of previous scholastic performance, parental education, and differential employment opportunities. By analyzing two nationally representative datasets, we focus on Italy, a country with high rates of early school leaving and pronounced gender inequalities in the labor market. Our results show that gender effects are partially mediated by scholastic performance, a crucial push factor, and are stronger among low-achieving students, pointing to a higher resilience of girls to academic failure; parental education is highly protective, especially for boys. Yet, boys' higher propensity to drop out is also, at least partly, explained by better employment opportunities in the formal and informal labor market.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Pushed or pulled?

Under such circumstances, is it better to work in order to raise one’s income, even if life is more stressful, or to withdraw from the labour force? What is the association between employment and health? This is the question raised by Emanuela Struffolino, Laura Bernardi and Marieke Voorpostel in the particular context of Switzerland, where mothers of young children, whatever their conjugal status, are not encouraged by the government to work full-time. Using data from the Swiss Household Panel, the authors analyse the relationship between self-reported health and full-time or part-time working for lone mothers relative to mothers in couples, by level of education. They highlight the higher risk of poor self-reported health for lone mothers compared with mothers in a couple, especially for those in small part-time jobs.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Self-reported health among lone mothers in Switzerland.

The impact of deregulation and flexibilization processes on careers is still unclear. In order to detect vulnerable profiles of workers, it would be useful to analyse the pathways followed by individuals rather than single transitions between different contractual arrangements. The paper focuses on the first eight years of labour market participation. A comparison among four Italian workers' cohorts is carried out by using the AD-SILC panel, which matches information from the National Social Security's registers (INPS) and the Italian survey data from the 2005 wave of EU-SILC (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions). First we describe how the features of labour market participation evolve across the cohorts. Second, we highlight the individual characteristics associated with the different career profiles, focussing on the role played by parental background. Finally, we inquire whether different types of trajectories are associated with wage penalties and whether a reproduction of wage inequality through the influence of parental background emerges. The results of the comparison between entry trajectories give support to the hypothesis concerning the high complexity of Italian workers' careers even for the older cohorts. A certain stability of career profiles exists across cohorts, apart from a reduction of the shares of those leaving the (regular) labour force. This is probably connected to cohort effects and to the increasing female participation to the labour market. Moreover, specific careers and trajectories outcomes are strictly associated with individuals' socioeconomic characteristics. Even after controlling for the educational level, the entry pathway is connected to the family background. In addition, the early career pattern results in a considerable wage differential (through the different accumulated seniority) for those workers who achieve dependent employment after eight years of labour market participation, hence engendering a permanent penalty for those having followed less stable careers. Finally, the analysis confirms that in Italy coming from a disadvantaged family background negatively affects earnings, even when main outcomes (e.g. education, delay in education, seniority, occupation and sector) are controlled for.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Traiettorie lavorative e salariali a inizio carriera in Italia.

However, few studies have been conducted on the intersection of the two competing definitions. The aim of the paper is twofold. In order to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between the individual and the familiar levels, firstly we wonder if the different definitions identify distinct subpopulation of workers at risk of poverty. Then we consider weather and to what extent the role of individual and familiar variables determining the likelihood to be a working poor according to the diverging definitions has changed after the crisis of 2008. The analysis on Eu-Silc cross-sectional data (European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, waves from 2005 to 2010) reveal that pointing out alternatively the individual level rather than the familiar one lead to distinguish heterogeneous subpopulations exposed to distinct risk of poverty. However, the phenomenon seems to have structural features that endure despite the crisis.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Working poor.
